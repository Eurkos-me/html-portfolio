    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    Welcome! Let's talk a bit about what I do with my free time. I'm very much a home body, as you'll see below.
    <hr />
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>I spend a fairly significant portion of my free time playing video games. Some say too much, but to them I say I don't need that sort of negativity in my life!</p>
    <h3><u>Currently Playing</u></h3>
    <p><b><a href=https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-4 target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/1200px-Fallout_4_logo.png" width="200"></a></b><br />
        I played through this game originally when it released back in 2015, but Amazon's recent release of the Fallout series gave me the bug again. And so, I find myself once again wandering around the Commonwealth.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><a href=https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/Starfield_logo.svg.png" width="200"></a></b><br />
        Another Bethesda behemoth, Starfield is a game that has a similar heart to others like Fallout and Elder Scrolls. However, instead of exploring a post-war wasteland or a high-fantasy realm, the player can explore the stars.

        <a href=https://aggrocrab.com/ACT target="_blank"><img src="../assets/images/act.png" width="200"></a><br />
        I'm not usually a fan of the souls-like genre, but I'm chipping away at this one for two reasons:
        <ol>
            <li>It isn't as dark and moody as the other souls-like games.</li>
            <li>There are options to turn down the relentless difficulty.</li>
        </ol>        
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>Movies and Series</h2>
    <p>
        Movies and television are a big part of what I do, as well. A perfect night for me involves grabbing some snacks, planting myself on my couch next to my wife, and watching a story unfold on my TV.<br />
        <h3><u>Recent Watches</u></h3>
        <b>Fallout (Amazon Prime Video)</b><br />
        I was pleasantly surprised by how well done this series is. It feels so much like the games that, as mentioned above with Fallout 4, it made me want to get back into playing them again. The acting was all top tier, the show is well written and well shot, and the post production was very well done. Definitely check it out if you haven't already.<br />
        <br />
        <b>Night Shift</b><br />
        I wasn't a big horror movie fan until after I met my wife, but she got me into them. This one was pretty good - the pace was a little slow at first and I felt like the twist at the end was a little predictable, but still definitely worth a watch.<br />
        <br />
        <b>X-Men '97</b><br />
        This series is still ongoing (one more episode!), and has been fantastic. The nostalgia hits exactly as it should, but even outside of that aspect it's a great show so far. If you haven't watched any of the old X-Men animated series you'd probably at least want to find a summary somewhere, but don't let that stop you from checking this series out if you're interested.
